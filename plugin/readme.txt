### Catholic Reference Extension for Wordpress ###

Thank you for downloading the Catholic Reference Extension for Wordpress!


#### Prerequisites ####

- The CRE for Wordpress requires PHP 5.
- It also relies on jQuery, which comes with Wordpress 2.2+.  If you do not
have a file /wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js, download jquery.js from
http://jquery.com and put it there.


#### Installation ####

The CRE can be install just like any normal Wordpress plugin: simply move the
unpacked contents of this package to your Wordpress plugin directory.  This
is normally /wordpress-root/wp-content/plugins, where /wordpress-root is the
directory where Wordpress is installed.

If you did not download the full CRE package which also contains the texts
(Bible and Catechism), then you must go to http://blog.purepistos.net/index.php/cre/
and download the texts separately from there.  The CRE will not function
without the texts.


#### Contact ####

I hope you get some benefit out of using the CRE with your blog.  If you have
any questions or comments, feel free to visit my blog and leave your comments.

Thank you, and God bless!
