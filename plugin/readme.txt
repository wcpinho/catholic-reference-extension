### Catholic Reference Extension for Wordpress ###

Thank you for downloading the Catholic Reference Extension for Wordpress!

To install the CRE, simply move the unpacked contents of this package to your
wordpress plugin directory.  This is normally /wordpress-root/wp-content/plugins,
where /wordpress-root is the directory where Wordpress is installed.

If you did not download the full CRE package which also contains the texts
(Bible and Catechism), then you must go to http://blog.purepistos.net/index.php/cre/
and download the texts separately from there.  The CRE will not function without
the texts.


I hope you get some benefit out of using the CRE with your blog.  If you have
any questions or comments, feel free to visit my blog and leave your comments.

Thank you, and God bless!
