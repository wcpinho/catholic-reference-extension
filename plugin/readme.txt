Requires at least: 2.0
Tested up to: 2.2.1
Stable tag: 0.8.7

Activates both Scripture references and references to the Catechism of the
Catholic Church, showing non-intrusive popups when you mouseover them.

== Description ==

The CRE is a Wordpress plugin which activates both Scripture references and
references to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, showing non-intrusive
popups when you mouseover them.  No awkward wrapper syntax is required.
References in old posts and pages are automatically activated.

== Installation ==

The CRE can be installed just like any normal Wordpress plugin: simply move the
unpacked contents of this package into a directory called "catholic-reference"
under your Wordpress plugin directory.  The plugin directory is normally
/wordpress-root/wp-content/plugins, where /wordpress-root is the directory
where Wordpress is installed.

If you did not download the full CRE package which also contains the texts
(Bible and Catechism), then you must go to http://blog.purepistos.net/index.php/cre/
and download the texts separately from there.  The CRE will not function
without the texts.

== Usage ==

The CRE will automatically convert most typical forms of Scripture references.
You can refer to the book by its full name, or by an abbreviation.

To refer to a Catechism paragraph, use "CCC" before the paragraph number(s).
For example: CCC 1210-1212.

If for some reason you do not want the CRE to activate some text, put an
exclamation point in front.  For example: !John 3:16.  

To quote a passage and have it appear right in your blog post (instead of in
a popup), use the ` character (the key to the left of the number 1 on most
keyboards).  For example: `Matthew 28:18-20.

== Contact ==

I hope you get some benefit out of using the CRE with your blog.  If you have
any questions or comments, feel free to visit my blog and leave a comment.

Thank you, and God bless!
