2101 In many circumstances, the Christian is called to make promises to God. Baptism and Confirmation, Matrimony and Holy Orders always entail promises. Out of personal devotion, the Christian may also promise to God this action, that prayer, this alms-giving, that pilgrimage, and so forth. Fidelity to promises made to God is a sign of the respect owed to the divine majesty and of love for a faithful God.

2110 The first commandment forbids honoring gods other than the one Lord who has revealed himself to his people. It proscribes superstition and irreligion. Superstition in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion; irreligion is the vice contrary by defect to the virtue of religion.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2111 Superstition is the deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand, is to fall into superstition.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-27W" href="#$27W">41</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2112 The first commandment condemns polytheism. It requires man neither to believe in, nor to venerate, other divinities than the one true God. Scripture constantly recalls this rejection of "idols, (of) silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see." These empty idols make their worshippers empty: "Those who make them are like them; so are all who trust in them."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-27X" href="#$27X">42</a></sup></font> God, however, is the "living God"<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-27Y" href="#$27Y">43</a></sup></font> who gives life and intervenes in history.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2113 Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains a constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature in place of God, whether this be gods or demons (for example, satanism), power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state, money, etc. Jesus says, "You cannot serve God and mammon."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-27Z" href="#$27Z">44</a></sup></font> Many martyrs died for not adoring "the Beast"<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-280" href="#$280">45</a></sup></font> refusing even to simulate such worship. Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore incompatible with communion with God.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-281" href="#$281">46</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2114 Human life finds its unity in the adoration of the one God. the commandment to worship the Lord alone integrates man and saves him from an endless disintegration. Idolatry is a perversion of man's innate religious sense. An idolater is someone who "transfers his indestructible notion of God to anything other than God."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-282" href="#$282">47</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2115 God can reveal the future to his prophets or to other saints. Still, a sound Christian attitude consists in putting oneself confidently into the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the future, and giving up all unhealthy curiosity about it. Improvidence, however, can constitute a lack of responsibility.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2116 All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to "unveil" the future.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-283" href="#$283">48</a></sup></font> Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and loving fear that we owe to God alone.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2117 All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have a supernatural power over others - even if this were for the sake of restoring their health - are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied by the intention of harming someone, or when they have recourse to the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible. Spiritism often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her part warns the faithful against it. Recourse to so-called traditional cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the exploitation of another's credulity.

<div class='cccp'>
2118 God's first commandment condemns the main sins of irreligion: tempting God, in words or deeds, sacrilege, and simony.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2119 Tempting God consists in putting his goodness and almighty power to the test by word or deed. Thus Satan tried to induce Jesus to throw himself down from the Temple and, by this gesture, force God to act.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-284" href="#$284">49</a></sup></font> Jesus opposed Satan with the word of God: "You shall not put the LORD your God to the test." <font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-285" href="#$285">50</a></sup></font> The challenge contained in such tempting of God wounds the respect and trust we owe our Creator and Lord. It always harbors doubt about his love, his providence, and his power.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-286" href="#$286">51</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2120 Sacrilege consists in profaning or treating unworthily the sacraments and other liturgical actions, as well as persons, things, or places consecrated to God. Sacrilege is a grave sin especially when committed against the Eucharist, for in this sacrament the true Body of Christ is made substantially present for us.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-287" href="#$287">52</a></sup></font>

<div class='cccp'>
2121 Simony is defined as the buying or selling of spiritual things.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-288" href="#$288">53</a></sup></font> To Simon the magician, who wanted to buy the spiritual power he saw at work in the apostles, St. Peter responded: "Your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain God's gift with money!"<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-289" href="#$289">54</a></sup></font> Peter thus held to the words of Jesus: "You received without pay, give without pay."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28A" href="#$28A">55</a></sup></font> It is impossible to appropriate to oneself spiritual goods and behave toward them as their owner or master, for they have their source in God.

2124 The name "atheism" covers many very different phenomena. One common form is the practical materialism which restricts its needs and aspirations to space and time. Atheistic humanism falsely considers man to be "an end to himself, and the sole maker, with supreme control, of his own history."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28E" href="#$28E">59</a></sup></font> Another form of contemporary atheism looks for the liberation of man through economic and social liberation.

2125 Since it rejects or denies the existence of God, atheism is a sin against the virtue of religion.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28G" href="#$28G">61</a></sup></font> The imputability of this offense can be significantly diminished in virtue of the intentions and the circumstances. "Believers can have more than a little to do with the rise of atheism.

2126 Atheism is often based on a false conception of human autonomy, exaggerated to the point of refusing any dependence on God.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28I" href="#$28I">63</a></sup></font> Yet, "to acknowledge God is in no way to oppose the dignity of man, since such dignity is grounded and brought to perfection in God...."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28J" href="#$28J">64</a></sup></font> "For the Church knows full well that her message is in harmony with the most secret desires of the human heart."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28K" href="#$28K">65</a></sup></font>

2127 Agnosticism assumes a number of forms. In certain cases the agnostic refrains from denying God; instead he postulates the existence of a transcendent being which is incapable of revealing itself, and about which nothing can be said. In other cases, the agnostic makes no judgment about God's existence, declaring it impossible to prove, or even to affirm or deny.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2128 Agnosticism can sometimes include a certain search for God, but it can equally express indifferentism, a flight from the ultimate question of existence, and a sluggish moral conscience. Agnosticism is all too often equivalent to practical atheism.

<div class='cccp'>
2129 The divine injunction included the prohibition of every representation of God by the hand of man. Deuteronomy explains: "Since you saw no form on the day that the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, beware lest you act corruptly by making a graven image for yourselves, in the form of any figure...."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28L" href="#$28L">66</a></sup></font> It is the absolutely transcendent God who revealed himself to Israel. "He is the all," but at the same time "he is greater than all his works."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28M" href="#$28M">67</a></sup></font> He is "the author of beauty."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28N" href="#$28N">68</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2130 Nevertheless, already in the Old Testament, God ordained or permitted the making of images that pointed symbolically toward salvation by the incarnate Word: so it was with the bronze serpent, the ark of the covenant, and the cherubim.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28O" href="#$28O">69</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2131 Basing itself on the mystery of the incarnate Word, the seventh ecumenical council at Nicaea (787) justified against the iconoclasts the veneration of icons - of Christ, but also of the Mother of God, the angels, and all the saints. By becoming incarnate, the Son of God introduced a new "economy" of images.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2132 The Christian veneration of images is not contrary to the first commandment which proscribes idols. Indeed, "the honor rendered to an image passes to its prototype," and "whoever venerates an image venerates the person portrayed in it."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28P" href="#$28P">70</a></sup></font> The honor paid to sacred images is a "respectful veneration," not the adoration due to God alone:

Religious worship is not directed to images in themselves, considered as mere things, but under their distinctive aspect as images leading us on to God incarnate. the movement toward the image does not terminate in it as image, but tends toward that whose image it is.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28Q" href="#$28Q">71</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2142 The second commandment prescribes respect for the Lord's name. Like the first commandment, it belongs to the virtue of religion and more particularly it governs our use of speech in sacred matters.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2143 Among all the words of Revelation, there is one which is unique: the revealed name of God. God confides his name to those who believe in him; he reveals himself to them in his personal mystery. the gift of a name belongs to the order of trust and intimacy. "The Lord's name is holy." For this reason man must not abuse it. He must keep it in mind in silent, loving adoration. He will not introduce it into his own speech except to bless, praise, and glorify it.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28T" href="#$28T">74</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2144 Respect for his name is an expression of the respect owed to the mystery of God himself and to the whole sacred reality it evokes. the sense of the sacred is part of the virtue of religion:

Are these feelings of fear and awe Christian feelings or not? . . . I say this, then, which I think no one can reasonably dispute. They are the class of feelings we should have - yes, have to an intense degree - if we literally had the sight of Almighty God; therefore they are the class of feelings which we shall have, if we realize His presence. In proportion as we believe that He is present, we shall have them; and not to have them, is not to realize, not to believe that He is present.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28U" href="#$28U">75</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2145 The faithful should bear witness to the Lord's name by confessing the faith without giving way to fear.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28V" href="#$28V">76</a></sup></font> Preaching and catechizing should be permeated with adoration and respect for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2146 The second commandment forbids the abuse of God's name, i.e., every improper use of the names of God, Jesus Christ, but also of the Virgin Mary and all the saints.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2147 Promises made to others in God's name engage the divine honor, fidelity, truthfulness, and authority. They must be respected in justice. To be unfaithful to them is to misuse God's name and in some way to make God out to be a liar.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28W" href="#$28W">77</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2148 Blasphemy is directly opposed to the second commandment. It consists in uttering against God - inwardly or outwardly - words of hatred, reproach, or defiance; in speaking ill of God; in failing in respect toward him in one's speech; in misusing God's name. St. James condemns those "who blaspheme that honorable name [of Jesus] by which you are called."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28X" href="#$28X">78</a></sup></font> The prohibition of blasphemy extends to language against Christ's Church, the saints, and sacred things. It is also blasphemous to make use of God's name to cover up criminal practices, to reduce peoples to servitude, to torture persons or put them to death. the misuse of God's name to commit a crime can provoke others to repudiate religion. <br /> Blasphemy is contrary to the respect due God and his holy name. It is in itself a grave sin.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28Y" href="#$28Y">79</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2149 Oaths which misuse God's name, though without the intention of blasphemy, show lack of respect for the Lord. the second commandment also forbids magical use of the divine name.

[God's] name is great when spoken with respect for the greatness of his majesty. God's name is holy when said with veneration and fear of offending him.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-28Z" href="#$28Z">80</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2150 The second commandment forbids false oaths. Taking an oath or swearing is to take God as witness to what one affirms. It is to invoke the divine truthfulness as a pledge of one's own truthfulness. An oath engages the Lord's name. "You shall fear the LORD your God; you shall serve him, and swear by his name."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-290" href="#$290">81</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2151 Rejection of false oaths is a duty toward God. As Creator and Lord, God is the norm of all truth. Human speech is either in accord with or in opposition to God who is Truth itself. When it is truthful and legitimate, an oath highlights the relationship of human speech with God's truth. A false oath calls on God to be witness to a lie.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2152 A person commits perjury when he makes a promise under oath with no intention of keeping it, or when after promising on oath he does not keep it. Perjury is a grave lack of respect for the Lord of all speech. Pledging oneself by oath to commit an evil deed is contrary to the holiness of the divine name.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2153 In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second commandment: "You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' But I say to you, Do not swear at all.... Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from the evil one."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-291" href="#$291">82</a></sup></font> Jesus teaches that every oath involves a reference to God and that God's presence and his truth must be honored in all speech. Discretion in calling upon God is allied with a respectful awareness of his presence, which all our assertions either witness to or mock.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2154 Following St. Paul,<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-292" href="#$292">83</a></sup></font> The tradition of the Church has understood Jesus' words as not excluding oaths made for grave and right reasons (for example, in court). "An oath, that is the invocation of the divine name as a witness to truth, cannot be taken unless in truth, in judgment, and in justice."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-293" href="#$293">84</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2155 The holiness of the divine name demands that we neither use it for trivial matters, nor take an oath which on the basis of the circumstances could be interpreted as approval of an authority unjustly requiring it. When an oath is required by illegitimate civil authorities, it may be refused. It must be refused when it is required for purposes contrary to the dignity of persons or to ecclesial communion.

This can be the name of a saint, that is, of a disciple who has lived a life of exemplary fidelity to the Lord. the patron saint provides a model of charity; we are assured of his intercession. the "baptismal name" can also express a Christian mystery or Christian virtue.

2172 God's action is the model for human action.

2173 The Gospel reports many incidents when Jesus was accused of violating the sabbath law. But Jesus never fails to respect the holiness of this day.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29H" href="#$29H">98</a></sup></font> He gives this law its authentic and authoritative interpretation: "The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29I" href="#$29I">99</a></sup></font> With compassion, Christ declares the sabbath for doing good rather than harm, for saving life rather than killing.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29J" href="#$29J">100</a></sup></font> The sabbath is the day of the Lord of mercies and a day to honor God.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29K" href="#$29K">101</a></sup></font> "The Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29L" href="#$29L">102</a></sup></font>

2174 Jesus rose from the dead "on the first day of the week."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29N" href="#$29N">104</a></sup></font> Because it is the "first day," the day of Christ's Resurrection recalls the first creation. Because it is the "eighth day" following the sabbath,<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29O" href="#$29O">105</a></sup></font> it symbolizes the new creation ushered in by Christ's Resurrection. For Christians it has become the first of all days, the first of all feasts, the Lord's Day (he kuriake hemera, dies dominica) Sunday:

We all gather on the day of the sun, for it is the first day [after the Jewish sabbath, but also the first day] when God, separating matter from darkness, made the world; and on this same day Jesus Christ our Savior rose from the dead.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29P" href="#$29P">106</a></sup></font>

2175 Sunday is expressly distinguished from the sabbath which it follows chronologically every week; for Christians its ceremonial observance replaces that of the sabbath. In Christ's Passover, Sunday fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish sabbath and announces man's eternal rest in God.

2176 The celebration of Sunday observes the moral commandment inscribed by nature in the human heart to render to God an outward, visible, public, and regular worship "as a sign of his universal beneficence to all."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29S" href="#$29S">109</a></sup></font> Sunday worship fulfills the moral command of the Old Covenant, taking up its rhythm and spirit in the weekly celebration of the Creator and Redeemer of his people.

2177 The Sunday celebration of the Lord's Day and his Eucharist is at the heart of the Church's life. <br /> "Sunday is the day on which the paschal mystery is celebrated in light of the apostolic tradition and is to be observed as the foremost holy day of obligation in the universal Church."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29T" href="#$29T">110</a></sup></font>

2178 This practice of the Christian assembly dates from the beginnings of the apostolic age.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29V" href="#$29V">112</a></sup></font> The Letter to the Hebrews reminds the faithful "not to neglect to meet together, as is the habit of some, but to encourage one another."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29W" href="#$29W">113</a></sup></font>

Tradition preserves the memory of an ever-timely exhortation: Come to Church early, approach the Lord, and confess your sins, repent in prayer.... Be present at the sacred and divine liturgy, conclude its prayer and do not leave before the dismissal.... We have often said: "This day is given to you for prayer and rest. This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29X" href="#$29X">114</a></sup></font>

2179 "A parish is a definite community of the Christian faithful established on a stable basis within a particular church; the pastoral care of the parish is entrusted to a pastor as its own shepherd under the authority of the diocesan bishop."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29Y" href="#$29Y">115</a></sup></font> It is the place where all the faithful can be gathered together for the Sunday celebration of the Eucharist. the parish initiates the Christian people into the ordinary expression of the liturgical life: it gathers them together in this celebration; it teaches Christ's saving doctrine; it practices the charity of the Lord in good works and brotherly love:

You cannot pray at home as at church, where there is a great multitude, where exclamations are cried out to God as from one great heart, and where there is something more: the union of minds, the accord of souls, the bond of charity, the prayers of the priests.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-29Z" href="#$29Z">116</a></sup></font>

2180 The precept of the Church specifies the law of the Lord more precisely: "On Sundays and other holy days of obligation the faithful are bound to participate in the Mass."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2A0" href="#$2A0">117</a></sup></font> "The precept of participating in the Mass is satisfied by assistance at a Mass which is celebrated anywhere in a Catholic rite either on the holy day or on the evening of the preceding day."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2A1" href="#$2A1">118</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2181 The Sunday Eucharist is the foundation and confirmation of all Christian practice. For this reason the faithful are obliged to participate in the Eucharist on days of obligation, unless excused for a serious reason (for example, illness, the care of infants) or dispensed by their own pastor.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2A2" href="#$2A2">119</a></sup></font> Those who deliberately fail in this obligation commit a grave sin.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2182 Participation in the communal celebration of the Sunday Eucharist is a testimony of belonging and of being faithful to Christ and to his Church. the faithful give witness by this to their communion in faith and charity. Together they testify to God's holiness and their hope of salvation. They strengthen one another under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

<div class='cccp'>
2183 "If because of lack of a sacred minister or for other grave cause participation in the celebration of the Eucharist is impossible, it is specially recommended that the faithful take part in the Liturgy of the Word if it is celebrated in the parish church or in another sacred place according to the prescriptions of the diocesan bishop, or engage in prayer for an appropriate amount of time personally or in a family or, as occasion offers, in groups of families."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2A3" href="#$2A3">120</a></sup></font>

2184 Just as God "rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done,"<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2A4" href="#$2A4">121</a></sup></font> human life has a rhythm of work and rest. the institution of the Lord's Day helps everyone enjoy adequate rest and leisure to cultivate their familial, cultural, social, and religious lives.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2A5" href="#$2A5">122</a></sup></font>

<div class='cccp'>
2185 On Sundays and other holy days of obligation, the faithful are to refrain from engaging in work or activities that hinder the worship owed to God, the joy proper to the Lord's Day, the performance of the works of mercy, and the appropriate relaxation of mind and body.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2A6" href="#$2A6">123</a></sup></font> Family needs or important social service can legitimately excuse from the obligation of Sunday rest. the faithful should see to it that legitimate excuses do not lead to habits prejudicial to religion, family life, and health.

The charity of truth seeks holy leisure - the necessity of charity accepts just work.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2A7" href="#$2A7">124</a></sup></font>

<div class='cccp'>
2186 Those Christians who have leisure should be mindful of their brethren who have the same needs and the same rights, yet cannot rest from work because of poverty and misery. Sunday is traditionally consecrated by Christian piety to good works and humble service of the sick, the infirm, and the elderly. Christians will also sanctify Sunday by devoting time and care to their families and relatives, often difficult to do on other days of the week. Sunday is a time for reflection, silence, cultivation of the mind, and meditation which furthers the growth of the Christian interior life.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2187 Sanctifying Sundays and holy days requires a common effort. Every Christian should avoid making unnecessary demands on others that would hinder them from observing the Lord's Day. Traditional activities (sport, restaurants, etc.), and social necessities (public services, etc.), require some people to work on Sundays, but everyone should still take care to set aside sufficient time for leisure. With temperance and charity the faithful will see to it that they avoid the excesses and violence sometimes associated with popular leisure activities. In spite of economic constraints, public authorities should ensure citizens a time intended for rest and divine worship. Employers have a similar obligation toward their employees.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2188 In respecting religious liberty and the common good of all, Christians should seek recognition of Sundays and the Church's holy days as legal holidays. They have to give everyone a public example of prayer, respect, and joy and defend their traditions as a precious contribution to the spiritual life of society. If a country's legislation or other reasons require work on Sunday, the day should nevertheless be lived as the day of our deliverance which lets us share in this "festal gathering," this "assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2A8" href="#$2A8">125</a></sup></font>

2196 In response to the question about the first of the commandments, Jesus says: "The first is, 'Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.' the second is this, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2AA" href="#$2AA">2</a></sup></font> <br /> The apostle St. Paul reminds us of this: "He who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. the commandments, 'You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,' and any other commandment, are summed up in this sentence, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2AB" href="#$2AB">3</a></sup></font>

He was obedient to them.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2AD" href="#$2AD">5</a></sup></font>

The Lord Jesus himself recalled the force of this "commandment of God."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2AE" href="#$2AE">6</a></sup></font> The Apostle teaches: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. 'Honor your father and mother,' (This is the first commandment with a promise.) 'that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth."'<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-2AF" href="#$2AF">7</a></sup></font>

2197 The fourth commandment opens the second table of the Decalogue. It shows us the order of charity. God has willed that, after him, we should honor our parents to whom we owe life and who have handed on to us the knowledge of God. We are obliged to honor and respect all those whom God, for our good, has vested with his authority.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
2198 This commandment is expressed in positive terms of duties to be fulfilled. It introduces the subsequent commandments which are concerned with particular respect for life, marriage, earthly goods, and speech. It constitutes one of the foundations of the social doctrine of the Church.

<div class='cccp'>
2199 The fourth commandment is addressed expressly to children in their relationship to their father and mother, because this relationship is the most universal. It likewise concerns the ties of kinship between members of the extended family. It requires honor, affection, and gratitude toward elders and ancestors. Finally, it extends to the duties of pupils to teachers, employees to employers, subordinates to leaders, citizens to their country, and to those who administer or govern it. This commandment includes and presupposes the duties of parents, instructors, teachers, leaders, magistrates, those who govern, all who exercise authority over others or over a community of persons.
