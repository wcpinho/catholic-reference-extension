500 Against this doctrine the objection is sometimes raised that the Bible mentions brothers and sisters of Jesus.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-J5" href="#$J5">157</a></sup></font> The Church has always understood these passages as not referring to other children of the Virgin Mary.

501 Jesus is Mary's only son, but her spiritual motherhood extends to all men whom indeed he came to save: "The Son whom she brought forth is he whom God placed as the first-born among many brethren, that is, the faithful in whose generation and formation she co-operates with a mother's love."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-J8" href="#$J8">160</a></sup></font>

502 The eyes of faith can discover in the context of the whole of Revelation the mysterious reasons why God in his saving plan wanted his Son to be born of a virgin. These reasons touch both on the person of Christ and his redemptive mission, and on the welcome Mary gave that mission on behalf of all men.
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
503 Mary's virginity manifests God's absolute initiative in the Incarnation. Jesus has only God as Father. "He was never estranged from the Father because of the human nature which he assumed. . . He is naturally Son of the Father as to his divinity and naturally son of his mother as to his humanity, but properly Son of the Father in both natures."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-J9" href="#$J9">161</a></sup></font>

504 Jesus is conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary's womb because he is the New Adam, who inaugurates the new creation: "The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JA" href="#$JA">162</a></sup></font> From his conception, Christ's humanity is filled with the Holy Spirit, for God "gives him the Spirit without measure."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JB" href="#$JB">163</a></sup></font> From "his fullness" as the head of redeemed humanity "we have all received, grace upon grace."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JC" href="#$JC">164</a></sup></font>

505 By his virginal conception, Jesus, the New Adam, ushers in the new birth of children adopted in the Holy Spirit through faith.

512 Concerning Christ's life the Creed speaks only about the mysteries of the Incarnation (conception and birth) and Paschal mystery (passion, crucifixion, death, burial, descent into hell, resurrection and ascension). It says nothing explicitly about the mysteries of Jesus' hidden or public life, but the articles of faith concerning his Incarnation and Passover do shed light on the whole of his earthly life. "All that Jesus did and taught, from the beginning until the day when he was taken up to heaven",<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JJ" href="#$JJ">171</a></sup></font> is to be seen in the light of the mysteries of Christmas and Easter.

</div>
<div class='cccp'>
514 Many things about Jesus of interest to human curiosity do not figure in the Gospels. Almost nothing is said about his hidden life at Nazareth, and even a great part of his public life is not recounted.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JK" href="#$JK">172</a></sup></font> What is written in the Gospels was set down there "so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JL" href="#$JL">173</a></sup></font>

515 The Gospels were written by men who were among the first to have the faith<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JM" href="#$JM">174</a></sup></font> and wanted to share it with others. Having known in faith who Jesus is, they could see and make others see the traces of his mystery in all his earthly life. From the swaddling clothes of his birth to the vinegar of his Passion and the shroud of his Resurrection, everything in Jesus' life was a sign of his mystery.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JN" href="#$JN">175</a></sup></font> His deeds, miracles and words all revealed that "in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JO" href="#$JO">176</a></sup></font> His humanity appeared as "sacrament", that is, the sign and instrument, of his divinity and of the salvation he brings: what was visible in his earthly life leads to the invisible mystery of his divine sonship and redemptive mission
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
516 Christ's whole earthly life - his words and deeds, his silences and sufferings, indeed his manner of being and speaking - is Revelation of the Father. Jesus can say: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father", and the Father can say: "This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!"<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JP" href="#$JP">177</a></sup></font> Because our Lord became man in order to do his Father's will, even the least characteristics of his mysteries manifest "God's love. . . among us".<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JQ" href="#$JQ">178</a></sup></font>

<div class='cccp'>
517 Christ's whole life is a mystery of redemption. Redemption comes to us above all through the blood of his cross,<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JR" href="#$JR">179</a></sup></font> but this mystery is at work throughout Christ's entire life: -already in his Incarnation through which by becoming poor he enriches us with his poverty;<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JS" href="#$JS">180</a></sup></font> - in his hidden life which by his submission atones for our disobedience;<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JT" href="#$JT">181</a></sup></font> - in his word which purifies its hearers;<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JU" href="#$JU">182</a></sup></font>- in his healings and exorcisms by which "he took our infirmities and bore our diseases";<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JV" href="#$JV">183</a></sup></font> - and in his Resurrection by which he justifies us.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JW" href="#$JW">184</a></sup></font>

519 All Christ's riches "are for every individual and are everybody's property."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-JZ" href="#$JZ">187</a></sup></font> Christ did not live his life for himself but for us, from his Incarnation "for us men and for our salvation" to his death "for our sins" and Resurrection "for our justification".<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-K0" href="#$K0">188</a></sup></font> He is still "our advocate with the Father", who "always lives to make intercession" for us.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-K1" href="#$K1">189</a></sup></font> He remains ever "in the presence of God on our behalf, bringing before him all that he lived and suffered for us."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-K2" href="#$K2">190</a></sup></font>

522 The coming of God's Son to earth is an event of such immensity that God willed to prepare for it over centuries.

531 During the greater part of his life Jesus shared the condition of the vast majority of human beings: a daily life spent without evident greatness, a life of manual labour.

May esteem for silence, that admirable and indispensable condition of mind, revive in us. . . A lesson on family life.

537 Through Baptism the Christian is sacramentally assimilated to Jesus, who in his own baptism anticipates his death and resurrection. the Christian must enter into this mystery of humble self-abasement and repentance, go down into the water with Jesus in order to rise with him, be reborn of water and the Spirit so as to become the Father's beloved son in the Son and "walk in newness of life":<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-LE" href="#$LE">238</a></sup></font>

539 The evangelists indicate the salvific meaning of this mysterious event: Jesus is the new Adam who remained faithful just where the first Adam had given in to temptation. Jesus fulfils Israel's vocation perfectly: in contrast to those who had once provoked God during forty years in the desert, Christ reveals himself as God's Servant, totally obedient to the divine will. In this, Jesus is the devil's conqueror: he "binds the strong man" to take back his plunder.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-LJ" href="#$LJ">243</a></sup></font> Jesus' victory over the tempter in the desert anticipates victory at the Passion, the supreme act of obedience of his filial love for the Father.

555 For a moment Jesus discloses his divine glory, confirming Peter's confession.

You were transfigured on the mountain, and your disciples, as much as they were capable of it, beheld your glory, O Christ our God, so that when they should see you crucified they would understand that your Passion was voluntary, and proclaim to the world that you truly are the splendour of the Father.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-N3" href="#$N3">299</a></sup></font>

556 On the threshold of the public life: the baptism; on the threshold of the Passover: the Transfiguration.

Peter did not yet understand this when he wanted to remain with Christ on the mountain. It has been reserved for you, Peter, but for after death. For now, Jesus says: "Go down to toil on earth, to serve on earth, to be scorned and crucified on earth. Life goes down to be killed; Bread goes down to suffer hunger; the Way goes down to be exhausted on his journey; the Spring goes down to suffer thirst; and you refuse to suffer?"<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-N7" href="#$N7">303</a></sup></font>

558 Jesus recalls the martyrdom of the prophets who had been put to death in Jerusalem.

559 How will Jerusalem welcome her Messiah? Although Jesus had always refused popular attempts to make him king, he chooses the time and prepares the details for his messianic entry into the city of "his father David".<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NC" href="#$NC">308</a></sup></font> Acclaimed as son of David, as the one who brings salvation (Hosanna means "Save!" or "Give salvation!"), the "King of glory" enters his City "riding on an ass".<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-ND" href="#$ND">309</a></sup></font> Jesus conquers the Daughter of Zion, a figure of his Church, neither by ruse nor by violence, but by the humility that bears witness to the truth.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NE" href="#$NE">310</a></sup></font> and so the subjects of his kingdom on that day are children and God's poor, who acclaim him as had the angels when they announced him to the shepherds.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NF" href="#$NF">311</a></sup></font> Their acclamation, "Blessed be he who comes in the name of the Lord",<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NG" href="#$NG">312</a></sup></font> is taken up by the Church in the Sanctus of the Eucharistic liturgy that introduces the memorial of the Lord's Passover.

<div class='cccp'>
560 Jesus' entry into Jerusalem manifested the coming of the kingdom that the King-Messiah was going to accomplish by the Passover of his Death and Resurrection. It is with the celebration of that entry on Palm Sunday that the Church's liturgy solemnly opens Holy Week.

<div class='cccp'>
571 The Paschal mystery of Christ's cross and Resurrection stands at the centre of the Good News that the apostles, and the Church following them, are to proclaim to the world.

<div class='cccp'>
572 The Church remains faithful to the interpretation of "all the Scriptures" that Jesus gave both before and after his Passover: "Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?"<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NI" href="#$NI">314</a></sup></font> Jesus' sufferings took their historical, concrete form from the fact that he was "rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes", who handed "him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified".<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NJ" href="#$NJ">315</a></sup></font>

575 Many of Jesus' deeds and words constituted a "sign of contradiction",<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NP" href="#$NP">321</a></sup></font> but more so for the religious authorities in Jerusalem, whom the Gospel according to John often calls simply "the Jews",<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NQ" href="#$NQ">322</a></sup></font> than for the ordinary People of God.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NR" href="#$NR">323</a></sup></font> To be sure, Christ's relations with the Pharisees were not exclusively polemical.

576 In the eyes of many in Israel, Jesus seems to be acting against essential institutions of the Chosen People: - submission to the whole of the Law in its written commandments and, for the Pharisees, in the interpretation of oral tradition; - the centrality of the Temple at Jerusalem as the holy place where God's presence dwells in a special way; - faith in the one God whose glory no man can share.

577 At the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount Jesus issued a solemn warning in which he presented God's law, given on Sinai during the first covenant, in light of the grace of the New Covenant:
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
578 Jesus, Israel's Messiah and therefore the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, was to fulfil the Law by keeping it in its all embracing detail - according to his own words, down to "the least of these commandments".<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NY" href="#$NY">330</a></sup></font> He is in fact the only one who could keep it perfectly.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-NZ" href="#$NZ">331</a></sup></font> On their own admission the Jews were never able to observe the Law in its entirety without violating the least of its precepts.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-O0" href="#$O0">332</a></sup></font> This is why every year on the Day of Atonement the children of Israel ask God's forgiveness for their transgressions of the Law. the Law indeed makes up one inseparable whole, and St. James recalls, "Whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-O1" href="#$O1">333</a></sup></font>
</div>
<div class='cccp'>
579 This principle of integral observance of the Law not only in letter but in spirit was dear to the Pharisees.

581 The Jewish people and their spiritual leaders viewed Jesus as a rabbi.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-O8" href="#$O8">340</a></sup></font> He often argued within the framework of rabbinical interpretation of the Law.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-O9" href="#$O9">341</a></sup></font> Yet Jesus could not help but offend the teachers of the Law, for he was not content to propose his interpretation alongside theirs but taught the people "as one who had authority, and not as their scribes".<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-OA" href="#$OA">342</a></sup></font> In Jesus, the same Word of God that had resounded on Mount Sinai to give the written Law to Moses, made itself heard anew on the Mount of the Beatitudes.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-OB" href="#$OB">343</a></sup></font> Jesus did not abolish the Law but fulfilled it by giving its ultimate interpretation in a divine way: "You have heard that it was said to the men of old. . .

582 Going even further, Jesus perfects the dietary law, so important in Jewish daily life, by revealing its pedagogical meaning through a divine interpretation: "Whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile him. . .

For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts. . ."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-OE" href="#$OE">346</a></sup></font> In presenting with divine authority the definitive interpretation of the Law, Jesus found himself confronted by certain teachers of the Law who did not accept his interpretation of the Law, guaranteed though it was by the divine signs that accompanied it.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-OF" href="#$OF">347</a></sup></font> This was the case especially with the sabbath laws, for he recalls, often with rabbinical arguments, that the sabbath rest is not violated by serving God and neighbour,<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-OG" href="#$OG">348</a></sup></font> which his own healings did.

583 Like the prophets before him Jesus expressed the deepest respect for the Temple in Jerusalem.

589 Jesus gave scandal above all when he identified his merciful conduct toward sinners with God's own attitude toward them.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-OZ" href="#$OZ">367</a></sup></font> He went so far as to hint that by sharing the table of sinners he was admitting them to the messianic banquet.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P0" href="#$P0">368</a></sup></font> But it was most especially by forgiving sins that Jesus placed the religious authorities of Israel on the horns of a dilemma. Were they not entitled to demand in consternation, "Who can forgive sins but God alone?"<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P1" href="#$P1">369</a></sup></font> By forgiving sins Jesus either is blaspheming as a man who made himself God's equal, or is speaking the truth and his person really does make present and reveal God's name.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P2" href="#$P2">370</a></sup></font>

590 Only the divine identity of Jesus' person can justify so absolute a claim as "He who is not with me is against me"; and his saying that there was in him "something greater than Jonah,. . . greater than Solomon", something "greater than the Temple"; his reminder that David had called the Messiah his Lord,<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P3" href="#$P3">371</a></sup></font> and his affirmations, "Before Abraham was, I AM", and even "I and the Father are one."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P4" href="#$P4">372</a></sup></font>

591 Jesus asked the religious authorities of Jerusalem to believe in him because of the Father's works which he accomplished.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P5" href="#$P5">373</a></sup></font> But such an act of faith must go through a mysterious death to self, for a new "birth from above" under the influence of divine grace.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P6" href="#$P6">374</a></sup></font> Such a demand for conversion in the face of so surprising a fulfilment of the promises<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P7" href="#$P7">375</a></sup></font> allows one to understand the Sanhedrin's tragic misunderstanding of Jesus: they judged that he deserved the death sentence as a blasphemer.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P8" href="#$P8">376</a></sup></font> The members of the Sanhedrin were thus acting at the same time out of "ignorance" and the "hardness" of their "unbelief".<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-P9" href="#$P9">377</a></sup></font>

595 Among the religious authorities of Jerusalem, not only were the Pharisee Nicodemus and the prominent Joseph of Arimathea both secret disciples of Jesus, but there was also long-standing dissension about him, so much so that St. John says of these authorities on the very eve of Christ's Passion, "many.. . believed in him", though very imperfectly.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PA" href="#$PA">378</a></sup></font> This is not surprising, if one recalls that on the day after Pentecost "a great many of the priests were obedient to the faith" and "some believers. . . belonged to the party of the Pharisees", to the point that St. James could tell St. Paul, "How many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; and they are all zealous for the Law."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PB" href="#$PB">379</a></sup></font>

596 The religious authorities in Jerusalem were not unanimous about what stance to take towards Jesus.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PC" href="#$PC">380</a></sup></font> The Pharisees threatened to excommunicate his followers.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PD" href="#$PD">381</a></sup></font> To those who feared that "everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation", the high priest Caiaphas replied by prophesying: "It is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PE" href="#$PE">382</a></sup></font> The Sanhedrin, having declared Jesus deserving of death as a blasphemer but having lost the right to put anyone to death, hands him over to the Romans, accusing him of political revolt, a charge that puts him in the same category as Barabbas who had been accused of sedition.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PF" href="#$PF">383</a></sup></font> The chief priests also threatened Pilate politically so that he would condemn Jesus to death.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PG" href="#$PG">384</a></sup></font>

597 The historical complexity of Jesus' trial is apparent in the Gospel accounts. the personal sin of the participants (Judas, the Sanhedrin, Pilate) is known to God alone. Hence we cannot lay responsibility for the trial on the Jews in Jerusalem as a whole, despite the outcry of a manipulated crowd and the global reproaches contained in the apostles' calls to conversion after Pentecost.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PH" href="#$PH">385</a></sup></font> Jesus himself, in forgiving them on the cross, and Peter in following suit, both accept "the ignorance" of the Jews of Jerusalem and even of their leaders.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PI" href="#$PI">386</a></sup></font> Still less can we extend responsibility to other Jews of different times and places, based merely on the crowd's cry: "His blood be on us and on our children!", a formula for ratifying a judicial sentence.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PJ" href="#$PJ">387</a></sup></font> As the Church declared at the Second Vatican Council: . . .

Neither all Jews indiscriminately at that time, nor Jews today, can be charged with the crimes committed during his Passion. . . the Jews should not be spoken of as rejected or accursed as if this followed from holy Scripture.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PK" href="#$PK">388</a></sup></font>

598 In her Magisterial teaching of the faith and in the witness of her saints, the Church has never forgotten that "sinners were the authors and the ministers of all the sufferings that the divine Redeemer endured."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PL" href="#$PL">389</a></sup></font> Taking into account the fact that our sins affect Christ himself,<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PM" href="#$PM">390</a></sup></font> The Church does not hesitate to impute to Christians the gravest responsibility for the torments inflicted upon Jesus, a responsibility with which they have all too often burdened the Jews alone:

We must regard as guilty all those who continue to relapse into their sins. Since our sins made the Lord Christ suffer the torment of the cross, those who plunge themselves into disorders and crimes crucify the Son of God anew in their hearts (for he is in them) and hold him up to contempt. and it can be seen that our crime in this case is greater in us than in the Jews. As for them, according to the witness of the Apostle, "None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory." We, however, profess to know him. and when we deny him by our deeds, we in some way seem to lay violent hands on him.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PN" href="#$PN">391</a></sup></font>

&nbsp;

Nor did demons crucify him; it is you who have crucified him and crucify him still, when you delight in your vices and sins.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PO" href="#$PO">392</a></sup></font>

599 Jesus' violent death was not the result of chance in an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances, but is part of the mystery of God's plan, as St. Peter explains to the Jews of Jerusalem in his first sermon on Pentecost: "This Jesus (was) delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God."<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PP" href="#$PP">393</a></sup></font> This Biblical language does not mean that those who handed him over were merely passive players in a scenario written in advance by God.<font face="Verdana" size="2"><sup><a name="-PQ" href="#$PQ">394</a></sup></font>
